            <p class="marginBottom15">
              I spent my early career as an academic mathematician, working
              somewhere at the interface between pure mathematics and
              theoretical computer science. I also taught at universities
              including UC Davis, UC Berkeley, The University of Sydney, Thai
              Nguyen University, and The University of Oxford, which is where I
              did my undergrad and PhD.
            </p>
            <p class="marginBottom15">
              In 2016 I left academia, at least in the formal sense, and became
              a startup founder/entrepreneur. I'm involved in a number of
              projects, some in a leading role, others in a supporting role.

              I generally welcome people reaching out, and try to respond to
              email eventually. For urgent matters I prefer phone calls.

          Back in 2013, when I was a lecturer at Berkeley, I wrote an email to
          my students. A lot of people liked it, and some people didn't like it.

          In 2015, also at Berkeley, I wrote some stuff about the Berkeley
          Mathematics Department. A lot of people didn't like it, and some

          In 2020, I wrote a piece for The Startup about the dynamics of
